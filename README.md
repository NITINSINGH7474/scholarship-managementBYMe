## 🌟 Overview

The **Scholarship Application and Management Portal** is a MERN-based web application that solves the complexities of traditional scholarship application processes. It ensures transparency, reduces paperwork, and provides real-time status updates for both students and administrators.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** (Local or Atlas) - [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- **Redis** (Optional, for caching) - [Download](https://redis.io/download)
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NITINSINGH7474/scholarship-management.git
cd scholarship-management
```

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd scholarship-backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `scholarship-backend/` directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/scholarship_db
# or use MongoDB Atlas:
# MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/scholarship_db

# JWT Secrets
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_super_secret_access_key_change_this
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_super_secret_refresh_key_change_this
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Redis (Optional)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Feature Flags
EMAIL_DISABLED=false
SMS_DISABLED=true

# Email Configuration (if EMAIL_DISABLED=false)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Twilio SMS (if SMS_DISABLED=false)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number

# File Uploads
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd scholarship-frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the `scholarship-frontend/` directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 4️⃣ Database Setup

If using MongoDB locally, ensure MongoDB is running:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
mongod

# Windows
net start MongoDB
```

The application will automatically create the database and collections on first run.

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

For a completely unified setup, you can use Docker Compose to build and run the entire application stack (Frontend, Backend, MongoDB, and Redis) all at once.

### Run the Complete Stack

```bash
# Build and start all containers in the background
docker compose up -d --build

# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# View logs for all services
docker compose logs -f
```

### Docker Services & Ports

The `docker-compose.yml` configures the following services:
- **Frontend App**: Available on `http://localhost:3051` (Mapped to 3051 to avoid Windows Hyper-V port reservation conflicts on port 3000)
